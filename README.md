### Install Visual Studio 2017
Step 1: Before you begin installing Visual Studio:
1. Check the system requirements. These requirements help you know whether your computer supports Visual Studio 2017.
2. Apply the latest Windows updates. These updates ensure that your computer has both the latest security updates and the required system components for Visual Studio.
3. Reboot. The reboot ensures that any pending installs or updates don't hinder the Visual Studio install.
4. Free up space. Remove unneeded files and applications from your %SystemDrive% by, for example, running the Disk Cleanup app.

For questions about running previous versions of Visual Studio side by side with Visual Studio 2017<br/>See the [Visual Studio Compatibility Details](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/productinfo/vs2017-compatibility-vs#compatibility-with-previous-releases)<br/>
Step 2: Download Visual Studio
Next, download the Visual Studio bootstrapper file. To do so, choose the following button, choose the edition of Visual Studio that you want, choose Save, and then choose Open folder.<br/>
[Download Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/?utm_medium=microsoft&utm_source=docs.microsoft.com&utm_campaign=vs+2017+download
)<br/>
Step 3 - Install the Visual Studio installer<br/>
Run the bootstrapper file to install the Visual Studio Installer. This new lightweight installer includes everything you need to both install and customize Visual Studio.<br/>
1. From your Downloads folder, double-click the bootstrapper that matches or is similar to one of the following files:
  * vs_community.exe for Visual Studio Community
  * vs_professional.exe for Visual Studio Professional
  * vs_enterprise.exe for Visual Studio Enterprise
If you receive a User Account Control notice, choose Yes.
2. We'll ask you to acknowledge the Microsoft [License Terms](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/license-terms/) and the Microsoft [Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-GB/privacystatement).<br/>Choose Continue.<br/><br/>

<br/>Step 4 - Choose workloads
   After the installer is installed, you can use it to customize your installation by selecting the feature sets—or workloads—that you      want. Here's how.<br/>
    <br/>1. Find the workload you want in the Installing Visual Studio screen.<br/>
 <br/>![](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/media/vs-installer-installing-workloads.png?view=vs-2019)<br/>
 <br/>For example, choose the ".NET desktop development" workload. It comes with the default core editor, which includes basic code        editing support for over 20 languages, the ability to open and edit code from any folder without requiring a project, and integrated    source code control.<br/>
